                   		Thirteen partners in RI have requested NaloxBoxes. Most serve clients who are homeless or engaged in drug addiction recovery programs. These partners working on the front lines of the opiate overdose epidemic confirm that there is a strong need to go beyond the current model of providing naloxone- individual medical provider-to-individuals.  They wish to create capacity for any bystander rescuer to promptly access naloxone to save a life using NaloxBoxes.

                    	<p>
                    	The first 6 NaloxBoxes have been installed.  Each NaloxBox contains 4 doses of naloxone, a mask for giving rescue breaths, information on how to obtain personal naloxone, and information on how to access addiction treatment.
